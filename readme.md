# Rare Hashes Telegram Bot

### Description

This microservice is responsible for notifying users via Telegram when new rare hashes are added to the system.

It acts as a bridge between the web server and Telegram users. When the web server detects a newly found rare hash, it sends a message through RabbitMQ. This service listens for those messages, checks the user database and notification rules, and sends updates to the appropriate users via Telegram.

The project is part of a system consisting of three microservice components:

- A [web interface](https://github.com/YaroslavWork/RareHashesWebsite) displaying the rarest hashes found.
- A Telegram bot that notifies users about new rare hashes.
- An [automated searching bot](https://github.com/YaroslavWork/RareHashFinder) that scans and uploads rare hashes to the database.

This combination highlights advanced backend processing, database management, and real-time user notification integration.

*"Do one thing, and do it well."*

### Project Structure

The project is organized into separate Python modules, each responsible for a specific part of the system. The entry point is **main.py**:

- **database_operation.py** - Handles reading from and writing to a local `.txt` file used as a simple database.
- **command_operation.py** - Processes commands received from the web server via RabbitMQ.
- **notification.py** - Manages logging output to the command line and writing logs to `logs.txt`.
- **telegram_utils.py** - Sends notifications to users via Telegram.
- **Dockerfile** and **requirements.txt** - Used to build and run the application in Docker containers.
- **tests/*** - Contains unit tests for validating the functionality of the service.
